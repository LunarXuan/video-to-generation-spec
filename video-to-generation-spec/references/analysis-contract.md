# Analysis and output contract

Use this contract for the internal analysis record. The record is evidence for prompt compilation, not a prose summary.

## Analysis principles

- Follow time order and cut boundaries.
- Separate observed facts from inferred cinematography.
- Separate subject motion, camera motion, and editing transitions.
- Track invariants across shots: subject archetype, silhouette, wardrobe palette, props, screen direction, relative positions, light direction, palette, and material response.
- For method-only transformation, abstract specific people, brands, logos, dialogue, and story facts while retaining their functional role.
- Copy dialogue only when the user explicitly requests transcription and the content is appropriate to reproduce. Otherwise record `speech_function`, cadence, emotion, and approximate duration.

## Shot table columns

Use: `镜号 | 时间/时长 | 景别 | 机位/角度 | 焦段/景深 | 构图 | 起始画面 | 主体动作/表情 | 运镜/速度 | 光线/色彩/材质 | 字幕/语言功能 | 音效/BGM | 结束画面 | 转场/剪辑 | 置信度`.

If a field is not observable, write `无法从视频可靠判断` rather than filling it from convention.

## Visual evidence contract

`visual_evidence` is the curated display set, not every frame used during analysis. Each item must identify an existing unedited source-extracted image, its exact timestamp, the shot it supports, its evidence role, and concise Chinese and English captions. Use stable IDs such as `E01`, `E02`, and keep chronological order.

Select 4-12 items by default. Cover opening and ending states plus the action, expression, camera, or transition changes that materially support the reverse-engineered prompt. Include at least one item per shot when practical. For long or highly cut videos, a timestamped contact sheet may count as one display item when showing every image individually would overwhelm the response.

Compilation copies selected images into `evidence_frames/`, writes `evidence_gallery.md` and `visual_evidence.json`, and records each image hash in the reproducibility manifest. In the final response, display every curated item inline with an absolute path from the compiled output directory. Put the gallery immediately before the Chinese and English prompt blocks. Do not display generated substitutes or omit a curated image after claiming it as evidence.

## Bilingual final-prompt package

First write the Chinese positive prompt in this order:

1. format, duration, aspect ratio, and overall visual method;
2. anonymized subject and immutable visual anchors;
3. environment, depth layers, time, light, palette, and materials;
4. chronological shot blocks with opening state, action path, expression, camera movement, ending state, and transition;
5. pacing, effects, environmental sound, and music intent;
6. continuity requirements.

Keep negative constraints out of the positive prompt. Compile the final copy surfaces as exactly two files and two fenced blocks in this exact order:

1. Chinese block/file `prompt_zh.txt`: `中文正面提示词`, then `中文负面提示词`.
2. English block/file `prompt_en.txt`: `English Positive Prompt`, then `English Negative Prompt`.

The English pair must be a faithful semantic rendering of the Chinese pair, not a shorter summary. Preserve measurable timing, subject and camera trajectories, audio intent, continuity anchors, and explicit uncertainties. Do not add details unsupported by the evidence. Store the English pair in `english_prompt.positive` and `english_prompt.negative` before validation and compilation. Never split one language's positive and negative prompts across separate copy blocks. Keep Chinese and English in separate blocks.

Prefer measurable timing and spatial relations over decorative adjectives. Preserve no more detail than the source supports.
