# Target-model adapters

These profiles are compilation guidance, not permanent API truth. Before emitting executable API parameters, verify the selected model version against its current official documentation. Keep prompt text separate from request parameters.

## Generic

- Produce semantically aligned natural-language Chinese and English positive prompts plus a time-coded shot list.
- Put durable subject and scene anchors before shot-specific actions.
- Express each shot as opening state, action path, camera path, ending state, and transition.
- Produce matching Chinese and English negative prompts. Keep each language's positive and negative prompts together, with Chinese and English in separate copy blocks as described by the analysis contract.
- Keep negative constraints separate from each positive prompt when the target supports them; otherwise append a concise avoidance clause inside the corresponding language section while retaining all four headings.

## Veo

- Write cinematic natural language with explicit subject, action, context, camera, style, temporal progression, and audio intent.
- Treat dialogue, sound effects, and ambience as first-class prompt elements when requested.
- Prefer one coherent 8-second unit per generation. For longer references, split on shot or narrative boundaries and plan extensions or editorial assembly.
- When visual continuity matters, recommend first/last-frame or reference-image conditioning instead of adding more adjectives.

## Sora

- Preserve the user's requested Sora adapter, but surface current availability warnings separately from the prompt.
- Compile a concise scene description with chronological action, camera choreography, lighting, texture, pacing, and audio intent.
- If generating through the legacy API, record model, duration, size, reference asset, and returned job ID. Do not pretend the API exposes a deterministic seed when it does not.
- As checked on 2026-09-04, the official Sora video API was marked deprecated and scheduled to shut down on 2026-09-24. Re-check before any execution.

## Kling

- Use explicit multi-shot blocks when the selected Kling version supports storyboards. Include duration, shot size, perspective, narrative function, and camera movement per shot.
- Express subject and element references consistently; prefer reference assets for identity and environment continuity.
- Keep dialogue order, language, delivery, and audio cues explicit for audio-capable variants.
- Do not emit camera-control JSON or duration limits until the exact Kling endpoint and model version are verified; capabilities differ across versions and providers.

## Wan

- Lead with dynamic content: subject action sequence, motion direction, expression change, and camera movement.
- Avoid spending the prompt budget repeating static details already fixed by an input image.
- Preserve and emphasize camera direction and temporal order.
- Alongside the required Chinese copy prompt, emit a compact model-native English prompt of at most 100 words when following the official Wan2.2 prompt-extension style.
- Record task (`t2v`, `i2v`, or `ti2v`), model/checkpoint, resolution, frame count, sampler, sampling steps, guidance scale, base seed, and whether prompt extension was used.

## Shared negative constraints

For every target, render the selected constraints in both Chinese and English and keep them semantically aligned. Place each negative prompt in the same language-specific block as its positive prompt; keep the Chinese and English blocks separate.

Tailor these to observed failure risks; do not blindly include every term:

- identity: face drift, age drift, hairstyle drift, inconsistent body proportions;
- anatomy: extra fingers or limbs, fused hands, broken joints, malformed facial features;
- wardrobe/props: color or texture changes, disappearing accessories, duplicated props;
- environment: background flicker, moving architecture, inconsistent shadows or reflections;
- motion/physics: teleportation, sliding feet, discontinuous trajectories, impossible contact, object penetration;
- camera/editing: accidental zoom, horizon roll, focus pumping, unmotivated cuts, reversed screen direction;
- rendering: temporal shimmer, texture boiling, ghosting, compression artifacts, subtitles, logos, watermarks.
